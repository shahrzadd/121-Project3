  After talking to the client and considering the target market, it was clear to me that we needed to create a
   very traditional, high-end brand aesthetic. I experimented with circular shapes and curve lines for 
   the look and feel of the website, and in the end, we decided to add lifestyle imagery to brighten up 
   the page's overall look. The simple green colour scheme conveys cleanliness and happiness.<br/><br/>

I kept the business card quite traditional and corporate and it was printed on heavy matte stock to
 give it a quality feel. I worked together with the client to source images that were bright
  and mainly Green and white in colour, sticking with greenery and interior photos rather than people.

  <p className="lead ml-5 pr-5 pl-5 text-p">
    
  I worked with the client to figure out the website structure and content. The sitemap was purposely kept 
  small and shallow to ensure that the website could be quickly and easily navigated. I sketched out
   some initial concepts and wireframes and discussed them with the client to ensure that we were
    both on the same page.<br/><br/>
    The main aim was to create a brochure website that showcased the service offering of the company.
     Once the client was happy with the initial direction, I moved into Photoshop to put some concepts
      together based on the brand and initial sketches. The homepage is centered around an image slider
       with the main website sections positioned on the left. The content page below that has a similar 
       layout with a strong focus on the content and imagery.<br/><br/>

       Some design challenges are harder than others, but when you have a great client to work with, it makes 
       it that much easier to achieve your objective. I had a great time working with this client
        and Iâ€™m glad that I could help them create a brand and website that met their company needs.<br/><br/>
